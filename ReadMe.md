# Budget Tracking
This is a simple budget tracking app that can manage a couple of simple 
ledgers and associated budget tables. The app provides some simple visual 
analysis and summary tools to review spending habits. The primary purpose of 
this project is to practice building basic Qt apps. The secondary purpose is 
to have a simple tool that I dont have to pay for, and hopefully to help out 
others in need of budget management.
